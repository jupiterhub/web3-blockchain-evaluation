# web3-blockchain-evaluation

This is to evaluate creating a decentralized app and leveraging on existing blockchains of Ether/Solana, etc.

Resources are based from https://solana.com/developers

## Jupiter's conclusion

- Solana runner is available at this repo: https://github.com/jupiterhub/solana-runner
- to deploy in solana you need to install rust - https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html
- you need to install solana too https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools#use-solanas-install-tool this will allow us to run and validate our transactions in local without deploying to the actual blockchain
- web3.js is a wrapper for solana, and compromises on flexibility for ease of use
- Anchor is a tool for automatically running the validator in local and easily deploy it to the blockchain https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/getting-started/installation.html#install-anchor
